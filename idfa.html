    <main>
        <section>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 26/08/2025</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to My IDFA. This Privacy Policy explains how Leong Eik Meng ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our iOS application, My IDFA (the "App").</p>
            <p>Our philosophy is to be transparent about our data practices. Our App is a utility designed to help you view your device's advertising identifier, and we have structured our data collection to be minimal and purposeful.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
            <p>Our App processes data in two distinct ways: for the core functionality of the App itself, and to support the third-party advertising that keeps the App free.</p>

            <h3>A. Data Processed for Core App Functionality</h3>
            <p><strong>Advertising Identifier (IDFA):</strong> With your explicit consent through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt, we access your device's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose of Use:</strong> The sole purpose of accessing the IDFA is to display it to you on your device's screen. This is the App's primary feature.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> We do not store, save, or transmit your IDFA to our own servers. It is only read from the device and shown back to you.</p>

            <h3>B. Data Processed by Our Advertising Partners</h3>
            <p>To support our App, we partner with third-party advertising services.</p>
            <p><strong>Partner:</strong> We use Google AdMob as our advertising partner.</p>
            <p><strong>Information Collected:</strong> Google AdMob may automatically collect certain information from your device when you use our App. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Advertising Identifier (IDFA), if you have given consent.</li>
                <li>IP address.</li>
                <li>Device information such as model, brand, and operating system.</li>
                <li>Information about your interaction with ads served through our App.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose of Use:</strong> This information is used by Google to provide personalized advertising, measure the performance of ad campaigns, and for frequency capping (to limit the number of times you see the same ad).</p>

            <h2>3. Sharing of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We only share data as described below:</p>
            <p><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> We share information with our advertising partner, Google AdMob, as described in the section above, to enable them to serve ads within our App. We strongly encourage you to review Google's own privacy policy to understand their data practices in detail: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>

            <h2>4. Your Privacy Rights and Choices (Opt-Out)</h2>
            <p>You have full control over the use of your IDFA for tracking purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT):</strong> You can choose to allow or deny tracking when our App first presents Apple's consent prompt.</p>
            <p><strong>iOS Device Settings:</strong> You can review and change your tracking preferences for all apps at any time by navigating to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking on your iOS device.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>The IDFA is only accessed locally on your device for display purposes and is never stored on our servers. We rely on the robust security measures of Apple's iOS platform. Our advertising partner, Google, is responsible for the security of the data it collects and processes.</p>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Economic Area). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
